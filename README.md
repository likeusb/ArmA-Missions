# ArmA-Missions

Created to have a public repo of all the ArmA missions that will be played in my ArmA group. Doubles as a handy backup of all of them, too!

# How to play them

# Step 1: Modpacks
Each mission comes with a modpack if the mission is actually complete. Download it. It is the "Arma 3 Preset (Something).html" file located in the mission folder.

# Step 2: Installation
This differs from one set to another. In the case of regular missions, where the folder ends in a .(Mapname), simply download the whole folder and put it into your "Documents\Arma 3\missions" folder. The steps for the download are listed in step 3
For the campaigns, it goes a little differently. Locate the rood directory of your Arma installaion, to do this go to Steam, right click Arma 3, then go to Manage, and under there browse local files. In the folder that appears, create a folder called "Campaigns" and in it, put my Malden Independance Campaign folder. 
After that, enable file patching in the Arma 3 launcher by going to the Parameters section, then All parameters, and then searching for "File patching". Turn it on and launch Arma. You should see the campaign under the Campaigns section.

# Step 3: Downloading the files
To download the files, click on the mission folder you want to download. Once there, go to this website: https://download-directory.github.io/ and input the URL of the folder you want to download. To do this, just go back to the GitHub tab with the selected folder and copy the url at the top.
And there you go! 

Keep in mind to actually use these files you will need to also create a folder with whatever name the .zip file is excluding the "likeusb ArmA-Missions main " part, so if you had
`likeusb ArmA-Missions main Malden Independance Campaign.zip`, you would want to turn it into just `Malden Independance Campaign` as the folder name.

And from there, just put the contents of the zip into said folder.
